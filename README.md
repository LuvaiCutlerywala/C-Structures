# Data Structures in C

Implementations of the basic data structures in C. The data structures are
very simple examples, as all are finite, deterministic data structures.

The structures implemented are:
- Hash Maps
- Binary Trees
- Graphs
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Stacks

### Completed Structures:

- [ ] Hash Maps
- [ ] Binary Trees
- [ ] Graphs
- [x] Queues
- [x] Linked Lists
- [ ] Stacks
